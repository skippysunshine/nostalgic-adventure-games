		Well, that was exciting!  And doesn't Tomahna look beautiful by night - well, once you climb up from the wreckage and clear your head.<p>
You are now cut off from Catherine and Atrus' bedroom, so head back to the botany lab.  If you look in the Control Box, you will see that everything is now powered.  Let Yeesha's bugs out of their glass tank (if you haven't already!) and watch them fly about overhead.<p>
Leave the botany lab and follow the walkway to the next room, where you can climb down a ladder located next to the tub of water (if you climbed down the ladder during the daytime, you may have seen Yeesha playing the flute here).  There is a lantern here which is now powered and can be tilted to shine on the family tree engraved in stone.  Take a photo!<p>

If you have played around with the bookcase, you may have realised that the names of the family members are written in the D'ni language on some of the books' spines and that you can push in five books before the system resets.<p>
The aim here is to select the 5 books that represent the family members <i>in their order of age from oldest to youngest.</i><p>
