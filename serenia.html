I'm so excited because in the two or three times I played the game, I never tried linking back out of Serenia via the book next to the pedestal where you first appear.  Hence, three years later while writing this walk through, I have discovered that you can link back from here to the spot you saw Catherine and baby Yeesha during Myst Exile III!!  I'm pathetically excited about that, and a bit miffed I never noticed it before!  I did wonder why they hadn't replicated that part of Tomahna.</td>

She appears at the edge of the stone platform after you have both spoken to Yannin and removed the winged snake lock from Water Device 4.  Have a listen to what Caradell says but there is no rush to get to the hall of spirits yet, so head back to the working harvester.</td>

<p>You end up in a stone stairway which heads down to a closed wooden door.
<p>One step back from the wooden door, there is a porthole into the harvester pool and a wheel.  Turn the wheel and a door opposite will open, draining more water from the pool.  But you need to get the water level even lower to get past the wooden door in this stairway.

<p>Head back up and lower the harvester once more.  Whilst it is lowered, open the hatch - you'll hear the bubbles of air escaping.  Close the hatch and then raise the harvester (quite realistically, I had to struggle back and forth with the large lever to raise the harvester - that was probably because I tried it too quickly but the effect was still good).  Once the harvester is up, you should be free to travel down the stone stairway to a locked metal door.  A memory from the necklace lets you know that one of Sirrus' colour puzzles is involved here.  Click on the button and a dial of coloured dots is revealed.  
<p>You have a colour pattern from the <a href="spire.html#Medallion">medallion in Spire</a> but you'll need more info from Serenia to solve this puzzle.</td>

		<td colspan=3><p>Okay, so the idea is that you need to collect the relevant offering and deliver it to your guide.  This is made a little more difficult, in that the guides do tend to move about a bit.  However, you can be guaranteed that all will appear somewhere in the stone forest and that they will appear in similar surroundings e.g. the water guide always appears in a round pool near a Water Device, the wind guide will always appear in a barren grassy area with small stones etc.
<p>
The relevant offering for a guide will never be more than four steps away.  The tricky bit is if you move your hand too quickly, the offering will disappear.  Also, if you dont find the correct guide in four steps, the offering will disappear on the fifth step you take.  Might take you a few goes and you might need to move around the stone forest a bit, but it's not too hard overall.  You just need to locate the possible locations where your particular guide may appear and the sources of correct offering near those locations. 
 <p>I was deemed to be a child of the wind (ahem!) in my most recent game. I found three locations where the wind tornadoes appeared within the stone forest.  I knew there were spore trees within four steps of two locations, so I would scare off the guide from the third location, then go and get a spore and approach one of the other locations.  It took me five attempts but I got there in the end.  Apparently, being deemed a child of fire is the rarest.</td>

So from Yeesha's central white light, I passed the hand one to the right, then one down, then one to the left and then back up to Yeesha's light. I repeated that until another light turned white and then excluded that from my rotation and brought another one in.  Sometimes I just rotated between 3 lights in a triangle pattern.
<p>You will often have to turn a white light back to red to keep your rotation going but eventually you will move around and make all the lights white (and if not, you will search on the web and find someone else's save game where they have completed that puzzle).</p></td>
