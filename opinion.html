		<p>At the time I write this, I have played all 5 of the Myst Series plus URU and while there were a couple of puzzles that drove me crazy, overall I think this is the best of all the Myst instalments.<p>

Big call; I know, but the different ages really had atmosphere and the 'interaction' with items and animals really made a difference.  The leaves blowing in the wind and the running water and the diffent views of Tomahna in daytime and nighttime were just spectacular.  This time around we got a camera to take photos of anything interesting (I can't tell you the number of notepads I have around the house where you flick over a page and find scrawlings from Riven.... or Uru).  I also found the camera a handy recorder of screenshots which I used in this walk through. <p>

<p>In other instalments of Myst I have sometimes found the journals a bit of a chore to get through but Revelation maintained a good balance between descriptive info and actual clues. The sound - completely stunning.  I always had the music frequency set to 100% but great that they gave the choice.  That chanting theme was completely hypnotic and I never bored of it.

<p>My favourite age was Haven.  The capture of that golden sunlight was just beautiful and the quasi-interaction with the ages animals was really enjoyable.  Spire did have it's own beauty in the ice cold of the crystals but I must say the difficulty of the puzzles there really made that whole age a negative experience.<p>

Overall, I think there was a good range of difficulty with the puzzles.  I'm the first to admit that I am not the worlds best puzzle solver or the most patient but I haven't read of anyone who said they breezed through all the puzzles easily and that's a good thing.</td>

		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td colspan=3><p>Let's talk voice acting. I thought Yeesha did quite well for most of her role, although was lacking a little in her final scene.  I thought Achenar was great and very believable.  If you have read the walk through, you'll already know that I thought that Sirrus was way over the top, annoying in a <i>Saavedro</i> style.  Loved seeing Rand Miller back as Atrus - it wouldn't have been the same with someone else playing him.<p></td>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td colspan=3><p>I think Revelation works well as a stand alone game, but also plays to those who have finished the rest.  It was nice to get back to Tomahna and I thought the linking in with the events of Myst III were well done - you could revisit the scene of Saavedro stealing the Releeshan linking book and Catherine with a baby Yeesha.<p></td>
</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;</td>
		<td colspan=3><p>One thing that had me stumped??  Where the hell was Catherine during this whole game??  I probably just missed a journal entry or conversation that explained it but if so, <a href="mailto:two_stroke_61@yahoo.com?subject=Where was Catherine during Myst IV Revelation?">can someone let me know</a>??  All I can remember is Yeesha guessing her mother was away because she wouldn't have been allowed to pick us up at the start of the game if Catherine were around.<p>
We saw evidence that she had been visiting her boys on Haven and Spire but if she wasn't in those ages or Tomahna or Serenia, then where the hell is she?  I'm starting to get a bit suss that Atrus has her body stashed somewhere...... or she's locked in an age he built, just like his sons. Maybe he never really wanted us to rescue her from Gehn way back in Riven.....?</p></td>
