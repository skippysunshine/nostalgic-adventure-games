However, something serious has gone down here and the room has been destroyed.  If you have already been to Spire, this will look familiar.
The necklace has a couple of stories for you here, one of which shows Yeesha in some difficulty.

		<p>Step outside and there is only one direction to move in – play with the crab if you like – it wont stick around for long.  Take the path up into the rock.
You’ll end up looking at some interesting rock art.  Swivel around to look at your options and firstly take the path that slopes up steeply with rope hand-holds.  Great view of the jungle here and you can make out some future points of interest such as a building and what looks like a ship’s mast.
That’s all there is to do here so back down to the rock art and then down the ladder to the beach.<br>Only one way to go here – on the right you’ll see a skeleton and the necklace will provide sound effects.  Zoom in on the totem pole and take a photo of the diamond symbol.	</td>

Exit the elevator and go down the stairs to the right.  You’ll see some cannonballs down there – just use your hand to roll them into the counterweight box.  By running back and winding the wheel and pulling the big lever in the elevator, you will work out how many are needed to operate the lift.<p>Once you have gone up in the elevator, you won’t be able to get much further.  Turns out you need to take up something to weigh down that panel.  Slide the small lever to go back down in the elevator and start experimenting with the box and cannonballs closest to the elevator.<p>  
If you slide some balls into the closest box and then slide that whole box onto the elevator, you’ll need to adjust the counterweight to compensate for the extra weight.  A little experimenting should give you the right answer.  If not, the correct answer is <a href="havenliftsolution.html">here.</a> </td>

</a>As your vision slowly clears you’ll see a very curious interloper poking you.  It hears a warning cry and takes off, quickly followed by a friend and a pursuing camoudile.  If you look down, you will be able to see the camoudile footprint and take a photo if you want. <p>
There are a few directions to go here <a href="havenmap.html">(map available here)</a>.  Lets go up past the tent first (and if you zoom in on the tent remains caught up in the tree, the necklace will show you the trip out into the forest again).<p>
Move two steps from the tent and you will reach a 'T' intersection.  Going right takes you back to the cliff where you started your tent ride, so go left and you will end up at a locked gate.<p>

</a>Zoom in on the panel next to the gate and lift up the cover to reveal the puzzle that unlocks the gate (you can also listen with the necklace here).  You’ve probably already spent lots of time fiddling around so my first hint to you is that the gate will unlock if one of the little hammers is resting on each of the white pebbles when the pebble is sitting outside it’s row’s slider. <br> 
The second hint is that the sliders will only slide when a hammer is resting in one of its slots and the pebbles don’t move at all.
<a href="havengatesolution.html">Here’s the full solution.</a><p>
Once you are through the gate, you’ll find a nice view of the lagoon and another totem pole to zoom in on and photograph.<p></td>

I thought this area was quite beautiful with many creatures to look at and it seems to be a favourite haunt of the zeftyrs. Step along the wooden planks and you will keep your feet dry!  When in the middle of 3 planks take the plank on your left side and you will find another totem with a symbol to photograph.  <p>
Go back and keep moving deeper into the swamp until you get to the lagoon. Head up the stairs and have a look around.  It looks as though a section of the walkway has been raised – guess who has to work out how to lower it.<p>

At the end of this pier is a wooden box with a lever that doesn’t do much..... yet.  Look up at the ceiling and you will see a handle you can pull down.  This lifts the lid from a weird looking machine. <p>
There are 5 knobs on the top of this machine and when you pull each one up, it scrolls through a display of symbols (although one viewer is broken). <p>
<font color="#CCF5C9">Hint 1:</font>  Display 5 symbols in the correct order and push the lever on the left to lower the walkway.   <p>

<font color="#CCF5C9">Hint 4:</font>   The order in which you display the symbols is based on the food chain on Haven – the animals from the top to the bottom of the food chain should be represented on this machine from left to right. 	 <p>

		<td colspan=3><p>Okay, first thing is to save your game so you can go back and work through the puzzle from the beginning as laid out here.	You can also reset the puzzle by going back and entering Achenar's hut on the lagoon.<p>
Have a good look around up in the tower overlooking the mangree nests - in particular note the drawing of a mangree throwing fruit that is behind you.  Fiddle with anything that moves and if you manage to solve this puzzle with no assistance whatsoever, then you probably designed it.  This is one of those ones that made my blood boil until I realised that life is too short and went to a hint guide.  I ended up getting hints from basic to the full solution and still had trouble getting it done (however, in the original un-patched game, the camoudile took much less time to scrabble out of the hole than it does in version 1.03!).	<p>	  
<div style="text-align: center"><img src="images/havenimages/camoudile-in--pit.jpg" border="0" width="133" height="100" alt=""></div><p>
After playing around for a while you may find that the mangrees respond to certain combinations of sounds created by turning the wheels.  When their ‘song’ is played, they will run to an empty nest that is directly connected by rope.  Also, when the mangrees run around they attract the attention of the camoudile below.  The aim is to get the camoudile out of action so you can go down there.	  <p>
Each of the mangrees is recognisable by a distinguishing feature and responds to its own particular call.
The camoudile will follow the moving mangrees and stay under their nest until the next mangree makes a move.  One particular move causes the camoudile to fall into a hole and it takes a while to scramble its way back out.  Beside the hole are some of those weird looking plants that you saw in the tall grass near the camoudile totem. <p>
Here’s what needs to happen:  you need to use the wheels to call mangrees in the correct order to ensure that the camoudile falls in the hole and then, before it has time to scramble out, get the Grandpa mangree into the leftmost nest and have him throw a fruit at the spore plants, causing the camoudile to pass out.  Simple huh?

Follow the walkway (make sure to look behind you as you go!) and take a seat in the chair.<p>
</a>You need to get rid of the snake but the necklace will give you a memory of how to do it.  The trick is to left-click, stroke and then release and do that four times.  Don’t stroke too slowly or it won’t work.  When the snake looks at you, click once on it’s head and it will go away.<p>
