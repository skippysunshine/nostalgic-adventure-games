The metal ruler part is missing!  Turn around and look back towards the bed and chess board.  Pass your hand over one of the bedposts and you'll get a magnifying glass, allowing you to zoom in and view the metal measuring ruler.  Must have been one hell of an explosion to embed it there!

Depending on what you have done elsewhere some or none of the 36 little crystals may be lit.  Nothing else works so time to move on - press the blue button again to raise the chair console.  I would recommend however, that when you get a reaction with other consoles on Spire, that you come back and see if anything has changed with this chair.	<p>
You can open the gate from the inside so exit the room and take the elevator up one level (you can also take it up another level if you ever want to leave and link back to Tomahna).  Once back on the laboratory/sleeping level, walk to the pole ladder and climb up to the top level.</td>

	<li><p>Enter the settings of the longest vibrating crystals first (as above, Crystal, Blue Crystal, Rock then Nara). </li>
</ul><br>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p>Be careful when moving the hand cursor.  On the outer strings, it is very easy to move too close to the crystals and then the hand changes to a magnifying glass.</li>
</ul><br>

<br>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p>Instead of trying to count increments along the sliders, try counting the lights e.g. if a slider was in position 1 and you need to move it to position 5, just count 4 lights as you move it.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p>When moving a slider to a high or a low setting e.g. to 10, just slam that slider up to 12 and count back two lights - much quicker than counting out 5, 6, 7, 8, etc.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p>The crystals start vibrating when a 3rd number of their setting is entered but they dont require you to stop on that number - just sliding past it is enough. Therefore it is possible to slide past the third number to get that crystal vibrating and continue on to position the slider in place for the next crystal, essentially making two moves in one.</li>

<td colspan=2><p>Have a look at the two containment units on the other side of the elevator. One is marked with 10-5-5 (stone) and the other with 12-12-12 (Nara). The necklace will show you the crystals falling down into the containment buckets.  However, we want an explosion so the idea is to get a crystal to enter the containment unit but not land in a bucket. Feel free to try both but I can tell you its the nara that creates a great explosion so move the buckets between the containment units to the left.<p>

Before you head off, note that there is a medallion hanging near the elevator lever - click on it to reveal 6 coloured dots and take a photo as you will use this information in the future.  It's also important to note that the pattern is individual to each game, so here's a photo of the pattern from my latest game but it's useless to you.  Get your own!! </td>
